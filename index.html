        <p>
          Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is
          the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or
          Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
          directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that
          the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website
          change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of
          how the field is developing.
